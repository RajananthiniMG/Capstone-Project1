# Capstone-Project1
YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing

Project Description:

This project involves collecting data from YouTube using its API, storing it in a MongoDB database, and creating a table for each data type in a SQL database. The data will then be connected to Pandas for analysis. Finally, we will fetch the stored details from MongoDB and transfer them to SQL for further querying and analysis. This allows for efficient data management, retrieval, and analysis, facilitating insightful answers to questions derived from the collected YouTube data.
